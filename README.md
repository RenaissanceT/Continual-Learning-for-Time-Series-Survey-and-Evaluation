# Continual Learning for Time Series Survey and Evaluation

## Project Objectives

Continual Learning aims to overcome catastrophic forgetting of deep neural networks during the incremental learning process with distribution shifts. While there has been significant progress in the image domain, Time Series Continual Learning (TSCL) remains relatively under-explored. 

This project aims to conduct a comprehensive review of Continual Learning, with a particular focus on Domain-Incremental Learning within the realm of time series data. Additionally, an evaluation of representative methods will be included to establish an open-sourced benchmark for the community. 

The expected outcome is the development of a detailed survey and benchmark paper, which will be suitable for submission to a top-tier journal.
